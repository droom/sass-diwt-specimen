<p>Miller Text, designed by Matthew Carter, epitomizes a reliable and attractive text font. Its utility and grace are apparent onscreen or in an off-the-rack fashion magazine. The Miller family of typefaces is a reinvigoration of the 19th-century Scotch Roman. This series was a team effort, with Richard Lipton, Jill Pichotta, Tobias Frere-Jones, and Cyrus Highsmith contributing at different stages. Carter & Cone's Miller Text is available in Roman, Semi Bold, and Bold with companion Italics.</p>
