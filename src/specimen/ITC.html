<p>By far, the most influential and successful type foundry of the 1970s and well into the 1980s was International Typeface Corporation. For nearly four decades, ITC has designed and marketed typefaces to creative professionals. The ITÂ® Library - comprised of more than 1,650 designs - features the work of world-class typeface designers. Some of ITC's most esteemed designs include the IC Avant Garde Gothic family - a typeface designed by Tom Carnase based upon Herb Lubalin's logo for Avant Garde magazine - as well as the ITC Berkeley Oldstyle design, a revival of Fredric Goudy's serifed custom typeface for the University of California Press at Berkley. Other watershed revivals include the handsome ITC Garamond and robust TC Franklin Gothic families.

<p>The ethos driving International Typeface Corporation's formation is as profound as the typefaces they produce: ITC began as Lubalin, Burns & Co and called itself "the first typo-graphics agency." Aaron Burns, Lubalin's partner in the company, was one of the most successful type salespersons and marketers of the 1960s. One of his first companies, Aaron Burns & Co., was actually a division of one of New York's then largest and most successful typesetting houses. Jobs that were sent to Aaron Burns & Co received special attention under the watchful typographic eye of Burns - and were billed at a premium for the service. While Aaron Burns & Co was a good moneymaker; Burns still longed to have his own company. In 1970 Burns and Herb Lublin joined forces to sell phototypesetting, lettering and typographic design services to New York advertising agencies and design studios. Their company, cleverly called Lubalin, Burns & Co, also offered several typeface designs created by Lubalin and his staff that could be purchased nowhere else; among them Avant Garde Gothic.</p>

Their company, cleverly called Lubalin, Burns & Co, also offered several typeface designs created by Lubalin and his staff that could be purchased nowhere else; among them Avant Garde Gothic. Jobs poured into the company. Burns - the consummate promoter and
businessman - figured that if his exclusive typesetting company could be successful in New York, it would be equally so in other large cities. Shortly after Lubalin, Burns & Co was formed, Lubalin, Burns Affiliates, Ltd was also launched. The idea behind Lubalin, Burns Affiliates was that there
would be an "affiliate" company in each American city large enough to
support a typesetting community. The affiliate would be an existing
typesetting house, which would be provided with an on-going stream of
new typeface designs. The typesetting house would then pay a fixed
monthly fee for the fonts - and for the association with Burns and
Lubalin. The problem was, Lubalin and Burns did not have the
capabilities to make phototype fonts - especially for text setting
equipment.
